# FrontEnd mail App - VerTech Fellows

### Run the application in your local

* Clone, fork or download a repo zip.
* Important: it is a requirement to have docker installed, so make sure you install it and that its engine is running, depending on your machine and specifications, I leave you the link for the docker installation process:
  [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* In the root directory, where the `docker-compose.yml` file is, open a bash terminal and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

* Wait for Docker to launch the application, when this happens you can access frontend on localhost:80 and backend on localhost:8080
